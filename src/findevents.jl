Create an event using the string `text`.

[`addevent!`](@ref) or [`addevents!`](@ref) for multiple events.

events. We haven't seen any editor that can read the text events, so far.

Find all "text" events specifield by `eventtype` in the `track`.

Instead, it returns three vectors: the first is the strings of the events,
the second is the indices of the events in the `track` and the third is
the absolute position of the events (since start of `track`).

not export the lyrics and text information when exporting midi files.
